# Customer-Churn-Prediction

In this project, I explored a sample dataset from IBM which simulates customer behavior. I created data visualizations using Python to understand the characteristics of customers who churn, and I prototyped machine learning models using Python to find the best performing model for predicting whether a customer has churned.
